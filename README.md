The purpose of this project is to programatically generate a regular expression that matches all numbers between a min and max value.  Inspired by an actual problem that I wasn't able to find a pre-built solution for. 

The name "Rangex" is a combination of "Range" and "Regex". Get it? I thought it was funny.
